A burger logger app created using MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and a ORM. 

## Description

### Before You Begin

* Burger Logger is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat.

* Whenever a user submits a burger's name, the app will display the burger on the left side of the page -- Available burgers

* Each burger in the available area also has a cutlery button that allows the user to "devour" the burger. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the right side of the page -- Devoured burgers.

* This app every burger in a database, whether devoured or not.
